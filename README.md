# QC-Simulator
This is my first attempt at making a Quantum computer simulator
So far I have commands that can tensor product, matrix multiply and direct sum and have added most needed gates
My next few goals are to add a universal gate U, add toffoli gates, maybe implement a time evolution.
Currently, to use you must combine the gates and vectors together.
Key:
@: tensor product
X: matrix multiply
+: direct sum
H: Hadamard
X: X gate
Z: Z gate
C_Not: C_Not gate
